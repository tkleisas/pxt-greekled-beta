# pxt-greekled-beta

Support for writing greek characters on the led matrix of microbit. Inspired by japanese katakana text package on https://makecode.microbit.org/pkg/mbitfun/pxt-katakana . Initially the code from this project was used as a starting point but eventually the code was written from scratch. 

This pxt-microbit package contains just one block:
showString that enables the sending of greek characters and has the following signature:
function showString(text: string, time: number = 500): void

## TODO
